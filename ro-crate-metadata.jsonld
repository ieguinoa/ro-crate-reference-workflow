Can I mix encodingFormat and programmingLanguage to describe the workflow files? it's indeed yaml format and also at a "higher level" 
how to identify galaxy using the URI but also identify that this was created and can be executed using a specific server/instance? can i use a different URI in the instrument of the createAction than the one in the programmingLanguage? one is for the generic Galaxy id  and the other for the instance specific, which one is which?
how to reference a specific Galaxy instance (e.g usegalaxy.be). is the url enough or should i create an id for the instance itself?
SHOULD i ALSO ADD  "SoftwareSourceCode" in the abstract cwl? its not really executable/interpretable by any software
In case the softwareApplication is actually a web server, would it make sense to use the date as a version? not sure if it's worth specifying the code version, it could also happen that the server is a running some "custom" code?
